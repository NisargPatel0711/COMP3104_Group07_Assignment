Software Development Life Cycle ( SDLC) is a method of software development, describing the steps involved in software development at each level. It covers a detailed plan for building, deploying, and maintaining the software
SDLC is it helps build a culture of security that is more likely to catch issues not only in development but in other areas of an organization as well
Software Development Life Cycle refers to the full form of SDLC
Prior to the 1950s, computing was not elaborate enough to necessitate a detailed approach like the SDLC.
The SDLC is not a methodology per se, but rather a description of the phases in the life cycle of a software application. In a broad sense, these phases are,:investigation, analysis, design, build, test, implement, and maintenance and support.
Being able to identify goals also help in discovering problems clearly.
It has various software lifecycle phases.
This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC.
As the complexity and scale of programming grew, the concept of structured programming emerged. Over time, structured programming demanded more tactical development models, thus sparking the beginnings of the SDLC.
