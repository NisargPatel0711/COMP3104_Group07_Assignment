The various phases such as continuous development, continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous deployment, and continuous monitoring constitute DevOps Life cycle. Now let us have a look at each of the phases of DevOps life cycle one by one.
The phase that involves ‘planning‘ and ‘coding‘ of the software. The vision of the project is decided during the planning phase and the developers begin developing the code for the application.
The code can be written in any language, but it is maintained by using Version Control tools. Maintaining the code is referred to as Source Code Management.
The most popular tools used are Git, SVN, Mercurial, CVS, and JIRA. Also tools like Ant, Maven, Gradle can be used in this phase for building/ packaging the code into an executable file that can be forwarded to any of the next phases.
