- Teams in development and operational silos needlessly prolong the production cycle. Collaboration between the two teams on the procedures needed to launch the programme becomes more challenging. Eliminating silos allows for close cooperation, which accelerates innovation and development.
- One of the main reasons a deployment fails is programming problems. The DevOps strategy promotes problem discovery at an early stage through frequent code releases. Together, the dev and operations teams can significantly reduce recovery time.
- The culture of software development has been transformed by DevOps. This is due to the fact that when all stakeholder teams participate in the development process, they concentrate on a single goal rather than pursuing various goals. Enhancing synergy enhances communication. Improved communication results in more efficient development cycles, quick mistake detection and correction, and shorter time to market.
- Continuous integration lessens the need for manual testing and development procedures. The development process cannot be automated for some jobs. DevOps concentrates developers' efforts on these activities, leaving the other activities to tools that can speed up development, including Cloud-based platforms, create accelerating tools that hasten code compilation, parallel workflow procedures let the continuous supply chain run more efficiently.
- All too frequently, people discover bad code after it's too late, which is unfortunate. The truth is that although some developers are skilled at what they do, others struggle with coding. This issue has a solution thanks to DevOps. When developers are regularly evaluated, it is simpler to evaluate their performance within a DevOps team and assign each team member tasks that are most appropriate for their skill set.
- Working in a DevOps team fosters inter-departmental trust and enhances interpersonal connections in the following ways:
  It encourages a deeper comprehension of other teams' struggles and what it takes for them to complete their jobs.
  Teams understand that other teams and team members may support them in overcoming the obstacles they experience at work.
  Alternative career routes can be established by networking across departments.
- The DevOps process builds quality into the development process, thereby reducing instances of unplanned work. A focus on security during the designing and development stage minimizes the need to remedy security issues later on, thus saving time and freeing more resources to other work.
- Because of the rise in black-hat hacking attacks over the past few years, security is a top priority for many firms. According to a poll, 54% of businesses presently entrust DevOps staff with the responsibility of implementing security measures as the need for security specialists continues to grow. It suggests that learning DevOps security best practises might expand your knowledge on how to handle security issues.
- DevOps practitioners are in high-demand as companies continue to seek out ways to improve workflow processes. A study depicts that 46 percent of IT firms see the skills gap growing and need qualified professionals to fill them. Though challenging, those who pursue this line of work should expect to earn a substantial salary. 
-  It can increase your career growth. You can become a Release Manager, Project Manager, Automation Architect or even a DevOps Evangelist.
