- Teams in development and operational silos needlessly prolong the production cycle. Collaboration between the two teams on the procedures needed to launch the programme becomes more challenging. Eliminating silos allows for close cooperation, which accelerates innovation and development.
- One of the main reasons a deployment fails is programming problems. The DevOps strategy promotes problem discovery at an early stage through frequent code releases. Together, the dev and operations teams can significantly reduce recovery time.
