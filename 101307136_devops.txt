DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term "DevOps".
