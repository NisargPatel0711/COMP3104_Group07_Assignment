Devops is my favourite subject.
DevOps speeds delivery of higher quality software by combining and automating the work of software development and IT operations teams.
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development ( Dev) and IT operations ( Ops ).
DevOps is about connecting these worlds and eliminating the chasm that exists between the upstream and the downstream
the best DevOps processes and cultures extend beyond development and operations to incorporate inputs from all application stakeholders - including platform and infrastructure engineering, security, compliance, governance, risk management, line-of-business, end-users and customers - into the software development lifecycle.
Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset
DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations.
In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams; engineers may do both.
DevOps outlines a software development process and an organizational culture shift that speeds the delivery of higher quality software by automating and integrating the efforts of development and IT operations teams – two groups that traditionally practiced separately from each other, or in silos.
